##How do I set up Project Pages for my own project?

Create a new repository with the contents of Project-Pages in it's gh-pages branch to use this template. A detailed guide is below:

  1. Install [GitHub for Windows](https://windows.github.com/) if you haven't already.
  
  2. [Create a New Repository](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/) under your user account or organization that you would like to host your Project-Pages instance.
  
  3. Create a Readme file if it doesn't already exist.

  11. Return to GitHub for Windows and write a Commit Summary (I went with Initiate Project-Pages), then click "Commit to gh-pages".
