<h2> StackEdit Tutorial </h2>

<p>StackEdit is browser embedded Markdown editor with many integrated features that makes life easier for those who do not want to meddle around GitHub too much, or spend time writing in Markdown or HTML.</p>

<p>1. Head over to <a href="https://stackedit.io/" target="_blank">StackEdit</a> and click "Start Writing Now"</p>

<p>2. This is the main interface of StackEdit. Before showcasing some relevant functionality, we need to set up the editor to work well with Project-Pages.</p>

<h3>Play Around</h3>

<p>8. Time to create and manage some content. The default Hello page in front of you contains a great variety of example usage of markdown, from basic to advanced.  For beginners, note the format toolbar at the top of the screen. This toolbar will provide basic Word-like functionality for you without you having to know markdown, just type as you would to a notepad, and use the appropriate buttons when you want to add style. Hover over the icons to learn what they do.</p>

<p>9. On the top right side, you will see a folder icon. Click on this to view different files you have, or create a new file. Note that the helpful Hello page is accessible from here. If you messed up the Hello page, it can be recovered from the "utils"" tab in the settings menu shown before.</p>

<p>10. On the bottom right side, you will see a small drag bar with 3 dots on top of each other. Drag it to access Markdown help, document statistics etc.</p>

<p>11. Now go back to the folder icon and select new document. Notice that the new document is already formatted with a YAML header for Project-Pages.</p>

<h3>Sync to Google Drive</h3>

<p>StackEdit stores your data locally, and will retain your settings and repository information unless you clear your browser data. To avoid losing data, and to be able to work on the same post from different computers, you can setup an automated sync to your Google Drive.</p>
