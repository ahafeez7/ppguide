<h2 align="center">Setting-Up the GitHub Repository</h2>

<p>Create a new repository with the contents of Project-Pages in it's gh-pages branch to use this template. A detailed guide to do this in 5 minutes is below:</p>

<p>1. Install <a href="https://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a> if you haven't already.</p>

<p>2. <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-new-repository/">Create a New Repository</a> under your user account or organization that you would like to host your Project-Pages instance.</p>

<p>3. Create a Readme file if it doesn't already exist.</p>

<p>Type anything for the commit button to become available. Then press the commit button.</p>

<p>4. Create a new branch called exactly "gh-pages".</p>

<p>5. Go to repository settings. (Shown above.) Make gh-pages the default branch. Press back on your browser. Also note the option to add Issues, and Collaborators highlighted in the image.</p>

<p>7. Open the cloned folder locally. Do not close GitHub for Windows.</p>

<p>8. Download the [latest release installer]() and place it inside the local folder.</p>

<p>9. Run the installer. Read through and accept the Apache License.</p>

<p>10. Click extract, the installer will extract to the same folder by default.</p>

<p>11. Return to GitHub for Windows and write a Commit Summary (I went with Initiate Project-Pages), then click "Commit to gh-pages".</p>

<p>12. Sync the local repository with the one at GitHub.</p>

<p>The header image can also be modified from this file by changing the variable "header-img" to your desired file path. Keep in mind the header will occupy the full-screen width, so it should be fairly high resolution. The image will also get panned and scaled under different conditions to fit the screen, so it is recommended the image be a thematic filler rather without any particular region of importance. If you would like to put a logo inside the header image, make sure it close to the center to keep it in the frame at all times.</p>
